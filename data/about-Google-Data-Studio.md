    - Rich with features and a slick looking UI
    - Leans on analytics a lot
    - Visualisations: lots of nice tables and charts (if you are able to load your dataset and configure the rest of it)
    - Can quickly get a report or chart created if you know the environment well
    - Links up to the rest of the assets / resources on GCP
    - Nice, sample walkthrough, helping learn how to build reports
    - Google Docs like sharing / collaborating functionality available
- Cons
    - Lot's of bells and whistles: there is a learning curve
    - Couldnt upload most of the datasets, it seems they had issues (while worked well with other tools)
    - UI wasn't intuitive enough to get from start to finish with a report or chart from the dataset uploaded
