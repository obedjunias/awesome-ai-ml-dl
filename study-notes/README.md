## Talk by Jakub Langr, author of GANs in Action

VAE = Variable auto encoder
Some GANs still use auto encoders as part of architecture
Most approaches use some form of maximum likelihood estimate (stats, not just ML)
We start with a random seed, just to make sure we don't always get the same example
Generate function is trainable
> Generative = generate
> 
> Adversarial = they compete against each other
> 
> Network = there's two of them
> 
> the random seed forms the latent space
> 
>  from this vector, what gives me a 4, what gives me a 9
>  
>  how do we control the generation?
>  
>  latent representation of the output distribution
>  
>  random seed allows us to manipulate generation
>  
>  i.e. if we JUST want to generate 4's
>  
> Discriminator
>   supervised
>   
>   binary classifcatiion
>   
>   real or fake
>   
>   Discriminator tries to fool generator, vice versa
>   
>   likelihood that input example is real
>   
> Generator (forger)
>   takens in a vector of random numbers
>   
>   generates fake examples
>   
> Analogy
>   generator = forger, trying to generate fake examples
>   
>   discriminator = detective (what is real / fake)
>   
>   back propogagtes error
>   
>   Real data is fed in, and generator generates fake examples
>   
> GANs learn iteratively
>   classification error - fed back into discriminator
>   
>   Generation gets better each time
>   
>   inspired by game theory
>   
>   non cooperative game
>   
>   minimise likelihood that real data is discriminated (classified) as fake
>   
> Generative modelling largely unsolved
>   doesn't generalise well
>   
>   can't generalise across domains

- General
  - Std dev: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation - the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma Ïƒ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
  - [Tensor and tensor rank](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/tensors): https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/tensors - A **tensor** is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions.
  - TanH: activation function
  - Histogram: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogramv - A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.[1]
  - Derivative: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative: The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value)
  - Partial derivative: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative - a **partial derivative** of a [function of several variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#MULTIVARIATE_FUNCTION) is its [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the [total derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_derivative), in which all variables are allowed to vary). 
  - Gradient: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient - the gradient represents the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope) of the [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent) of the [graph of the function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function). More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)) is the slope of the graph in that direction.
  - Chain rule: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule - the **chain rule** is a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula) for computing the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) of the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition) of two or more [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)).

        - **Is There a Standard Heuristic for Model Tuning?**
            - The short answer is that the effects of different hyper parameters are data dependent. There are no hard-and-fast rules; you'll need to test on your data.
            - Rules of thumb
                - Training error should *steadily decrease*, *steeply at first*, and should *eventually plateau* as training converges.
                - If the training has **not** converged, try running it *for longer*.
                - If the training error *decreases too slowly,* *increasing the learning rate* may help it *decrease faster*.
                    - But sometimes the *exact opposite* may happen if the learning rate is *too high*.
                - If the *training error* varies wildly, try *decreasing the learning rate*.
                    - *Lower learning* rate plus larger number of steps or larger batch size is often a **good combination**.
                - *Very small batch* sizes can also cause *instability*. First try larger values like 100 or 1000, and *decrease until you see degradation*.
                - Never go strictly by these rules of thumb, because the effects are data dependent. Always experiment and verify.
            - Questions
                - What is the difference between precision and accuracy?
                    - Summary: you can think of darts, precision is grouping of shots (how close the results/predictions are to a central point), accuracy is how close the central point of the results (predictions) is to the target (label.)
                    - This article explains more fully through an example: [https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9](https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9)
                    - The precision, recall, accuracy formula are shown below. Key: tp=true positive, tn = true negative, fp=false positive, fn=false negative. It also helps to see the confusion matrix, explaining how tp, tn, fp, and fn all fit together, see below.
