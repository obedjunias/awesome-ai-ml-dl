### Abstract

As a Java developer, to better myself, learn new and more interesting subjects and technologies, in this case in the areas of AI/ML/DL I have found that there is so much to know. Almost, "nn" things -- infinite number of them and constantly increasing by the day. During the session, I will show how I created my own order or list to overcome this problem and put them on this git repo https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-ai-ml-dl for everyone else to learn from. We actually have access to quite a lot of things we may not be fully aware of, let's see what they are and how we may be able to use (some if not all) of them to improve our knowledge.

To keep the session lively and interesting, I'll try to show a demo or two, and as takeaway share puzzles and thought exercises you could do on your own after the session is over. "nn" things every Java developer should know about.
