### Abstract

As a developer or a Java developer, if we look around and are following current trends, we can see how it's hard to keep track of technology.

Especially, with so much progress in the AI/ML space, we can sometimes feel a bit like we have been left behind. But with [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org) - a Java-based ML library, things are going to change for Java/JVM developers. In this talk, we will see how we can make use of the features provided and also interact/interop with other extended technologies and frameworks in this space. We will try to do all of this with the help of code and demos. Keep your eyes open for puzzles and thought exercises through the course of the presentation.
