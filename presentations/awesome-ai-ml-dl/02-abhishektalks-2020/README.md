### Abstract

In my journey to better myself, learn newer and more interesting subjects and technologies I have found that we often don't get access to all the tools or learning resources in the right order. So I went ahead and created my own order or list and then my own tools - both of which you can see via these two GitHub repos: https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-ai-ml-dl and https://bit.ly/better-nlp-launch. (Own tools = based on the great works of others who came before us).

We will explore the journey but also navigate through the subjects, the categories, sub-categories and the examples. Talk about the benefits and how you could get involved with https://bit.ly/better-nlp-launch (also see https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-ai-ml-dl).

Towards the end, I would like to share some inspirations on Masters, Grandmasters and Masters of Grandmasters (principles overlap with that of many fields be it ours or that of others). To keep the sessions lively and interesting, I'll try to show a demo or two, and as takeaway share puzzles and thought exercises you could on your own.
