### Abstract

As a developer or a Java developer, we all have had our share of experiences with the latest and greatest (and some State-of-the-art) libraries and packages in the ML/DL space.

During the time I have been looking in this space, I have come across a number of them in the Java space as well. In this talk, I will try to cover two such libraries namely Tribuo (see previous talks: https://bit.ly/intro-to-tribuo-slides and http://bit.ly/gba-apac-tour-2020-slides) and DeepNetts.

We will see how we can make use of the features provided and also interact/interop with other extended technologies or frameworks. We will try to do all of this with the help of code and demos.
